# Describe information barriers

[Describe information barriers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-insider-risk-capabilities-microsoft-365/4-describe-information-barriers)

An organization can restrict communications 
* between groups 
* between certain people

How it works:
* People who shouldn't communicate with other specific users can't find, select, chat, or call those users

Limitation:
* Information barriers only support two-way restrictions (no marketing across barriers)

Workflows:
* Teams
* OneDrive for Business
* SharePoint online
