# Describe Data Loss Prevention

[Describe Data Loss Prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/5-describe-data-loss-prevention)

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a way to protect sensitive information and prevent its inadvertent disclosure. 

It feels like it builds on top of [Classificaiton capabilities](21-Describe-data-classification-capabilities.md), but it doesn't say.

Here's some scenarios where DLP policies can help:
* Identify any document containing a credit card number stored in usersâ€™ OneDrive for Business accounts.
* Automatically block an email containing employee personal information from being sent outside the organization.
* An admin can configure a DLP policy that helps detect information that's subject to for example (HIPAA) across all SharePoint sites and OneDrive for Business. The admin can block the relevant documents from being shared inappropriately.

Supported workflows:
* Sharepoint
* OneDrive
* Teams
* Exchange
