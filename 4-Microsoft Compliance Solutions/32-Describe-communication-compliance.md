# Describe communication compliance

[Describe communication compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-insider-risk-capabilities-microsoft-365/3-describe-communication-compliance)

Enables organizations to detect, capture, and take remediation actions for inappropriate messages

Predefined and custom policies in communication compliance make it possible to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by chosen reviewers.

**Pretty much same process as for [insider risk management](31-Describe-Insider-risk-management-solution.md)

## Classifiers for offensive messages
* Targeted harassment
* Profanity
* Threat
* Source code
* Resumes
* Offensive Language
* Privacy breach
* **Can create custom classifiers for your company**

## Creating a communication compliance policy
1. Name the policy
1. Add users and reviewers of the policy
1. Add "Locations" - aka Exchange, Teams, Skype or 3rd Party Sources
1. Add conditions and percentage
    * Inbound, Outbound or internal
    * Conditions: Add one or more classifiers
    * Review percentage: Specify how many percent of the policy breaches you want to review
