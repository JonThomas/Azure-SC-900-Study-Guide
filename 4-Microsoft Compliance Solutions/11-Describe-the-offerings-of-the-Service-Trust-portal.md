The service trust portal is basically a place where Microsoft stores compliance material relevant to their services.

The Service Trust portal is available at https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ and https://aka.ms/STP

The portal provides information, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.

It also features the "My Library", which allows you to upload compliance and other documents.
