Retention labels and policies can ensure that content is kept only for a required time, and then permanently deleted.

Works with:
* SharePoint and OneDrive
* Microsoft Teams
* Yammer
* Exchange

## Retention policies
* Used to assign same retention settings to content at a whole site or mailbox level
    * If content in same site have different retention requirements, use retention labels on spesific content
* Retention policies follow the site, not the content. Content moved out of the site looses the retention policy

## Retention labels
* Used to assign retention settings on an item (folder, document, email)
* An item can maximum have one retention label
* Retention labels travel with content
* Labels can be applied manually or automatically if it matches defined conditions
* Reviews can be set up, before content is automatically deleted
