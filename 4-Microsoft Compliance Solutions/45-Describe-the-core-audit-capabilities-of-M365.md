[Describe the core audit capabilities of M365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-ediscovery-capabilities-of-microsoft-365/5a-describe-core-microsoft-365)

The audit functionality in the Microsoft 365 compliance center allows organizations to view user and administrator activity through a unified audit log. 

Searching the audit log requires the search capability to be turned on, and for the user doing the search to be assigned the appropriate role.

For core audit capability, the audit record is kept and searchable for 90 days.
