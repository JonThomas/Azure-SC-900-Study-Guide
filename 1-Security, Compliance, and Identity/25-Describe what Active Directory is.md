# Describe what Active Directory is

[Describe what Active Directory is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/6-describe-concept-of-directory-services-active-directory)

Active Directory was developed originally for Windows 2000, for on-prem solutions, and consists of several different services. The best known service is Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), that stores information about domain members, devices; verifies credentials and defines access rights. 

A Domain Controller is a server that runs ADDS.

ADDS doesn't natively support mobile devices, SaaS apps, or apps that require _modern authentication_, like Azure Active Directory with its "Identity as a service" (IDaaS)
