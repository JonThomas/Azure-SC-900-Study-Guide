# Describe what Active Directory is

[Describe what Active Directory is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/6-describe-concept-of-directory-services-active-directory)

Active Directory was developed originally for Windows 2000, for on-prem solutions, and consists of several different services. The best known service is Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), that stores information about domain members and devices, and verifies credentials and defines access rights. 

A Domain Controller is a server that runs ADDS.

ADDS doesn't natively support mobile devices, SaaS apps, or apps that require _modern authentication_, like Azure Active Directory with its "Identity as a service" (IDaaS)
