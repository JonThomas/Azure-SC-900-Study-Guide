# Describe encryption and hashing

[Describe encryption and hashing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/6-describe-ways-encryption-hashing-secure-data)

Symmetric encryption: Same key is used both for encrypting and decrypting

Asymmetric encryption: Either key can be used for encrypting, both keys are required for decrypting

Hashing is used to store passwords (not encryption). Hashing uses an algorithm, instead of a key. A hashed value is never converted back to its original value. Instead, the users password is hashed again, using the same algorithm, and the two hashes are compared to check if the user typed the correct password.
