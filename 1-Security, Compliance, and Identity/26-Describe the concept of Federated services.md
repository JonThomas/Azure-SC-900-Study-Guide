# Describe the concept of Federated services

[Describe the concept of Federated services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/5-describe-concept-federated-services)

When you set up Single Sign-On between multiple identity providers, it's called federation.

Federation enables an end user to access services in different domains or organizations, without reauthenticating. This works because the identity providers in the different domains have been set up to trust each other.

Trust must be explicitly set up both ways: Having a trust relationship from IdP A to IdP B, does not mean that users authenticated with IdP B can access services managed by IdP A.
