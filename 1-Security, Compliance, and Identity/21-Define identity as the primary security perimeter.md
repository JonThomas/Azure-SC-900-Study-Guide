# Define identity as the primary security perimeter

[Define identity as the primary security perimeter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/3-define-identity-primary-security-perimeter)

 An identity is how someone or something can be verified and authenticated to be who they say they are. An identity may be associated with a user, an application, a device, or something else.

Identity is the new security perimeter.
- because it now streches beyond company perimeter: 
* SaaS apps, like Office 365
* Personal devices
* Unmanaged devices
* IoT devices

Four pillars of identity:
* Administration: When and how can identities change, and who can perform the change?
* Authentication/ AuthN: How much assurance is enough to determine if an identity is the one it claims to be
* Authorization/ AuthZ
* Auditing: Tracking, alerts, reporting and governance
