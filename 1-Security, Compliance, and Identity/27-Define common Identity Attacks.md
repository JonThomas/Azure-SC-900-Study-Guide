# Define common Identity Attacks

[Define common Identity Attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/2-describe-common-identity-attacks)

Identities are attached using several techniques
* Brute force
* Password spray attacks (trying common passwords on many accounts)
* Credential stuffing (people use same passwords on several sites)
* Phishing
* Spear phishing (highly targeted phishing)

Mitigate risk by identifying suspicious actions related to user accounts.
* User risk: The probability that a given identity or account is compromised. 
* Sign-in risk: The probability that a given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner.
