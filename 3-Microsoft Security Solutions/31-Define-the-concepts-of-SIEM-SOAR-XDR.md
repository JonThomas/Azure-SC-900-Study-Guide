[Define the concepts of SIEM, SOAR, XDR]()

## Security information event management (SIEM)

* Tool for collecting data, like Sentinel, Splunk or Kibana
* It does analysis, looks for correlations or anomalies, and generates alerts and incidents.

## Security orchestration automated response (SOAR)

* A SOAR system takes data from many sources (like SIEM), and uses the data to mitigate security issues, by using for example automted workflows and  processes.
* Sentinel is both a SIEM and SOAR tool.

## Extended detection and response (XDR)

* An XDR system is designed to deliver intelligent, automated, and integrated security across an organizationâ€™s domain. It helps prevent, detect, and respond to threats across identities, endpoints, applications, email, IoT, infrastructure, and cloud platforms.
