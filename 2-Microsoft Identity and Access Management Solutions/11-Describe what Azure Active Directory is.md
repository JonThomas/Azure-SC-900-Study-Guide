# Describe what Azure Active Directory is

[Describe what Azure Active Directory is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/6-describe-ways-encryption-hashing-secure-data)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. 

Azure AD enables employees, guests and others to sign in and access resources, including:
* Internal resources (on prem apps, company cloud apps, ...)
* External services (SaaS services like Office 365, SaaS apps developed by your organization)

Azure AD can be synchronized with on-prem AD, and other directory services.

Features:
* Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Can automate user provisioning between AD and cloud apps
* Self service password reset
* Single Sign-on (SSO)
* APIs that expose organizational data(!)
