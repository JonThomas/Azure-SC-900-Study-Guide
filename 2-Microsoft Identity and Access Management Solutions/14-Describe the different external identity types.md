* Azure AD External Identities is a set of capabilities that enable organizations to allow access to external users. Your customers, partners, and other guest users can "bring their own identities" to sign in.
* External users can log in using external identity providers, like Facebook, Google, etc.

Two different types of external identities:
* B2B collaboration: Guest users.
    * Guest users are stored in the same directory as employees
* B2C access management: End users sign in using external identity providers.
    * External users are stored in the B2C directory
