# Describe the benefits of Azure AD roles

[Describe the benefits of Azure AD roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-access-management-capabilities/3-describe-azure-role-based-access-control)

There are many built in roles in Azure AD, preconfigured bundles of permissions, for example:
* Global administrator
* User administrator
* Billing administrator

Custom roles can be created.

Built in roles are applied on the tenant level. Custom roles can be assigned at the resource level, for example on an application.

Manging access using roles is called RBAC: Role based access control.

NB: Least privilege principle
